# GeoGuessr Daily Challenge Tracker

A simple Python script to track your GeoGuessr daily challenge scores and save them to a CSV file.

## Features

- Fetches your daily challenge results from GeoGuessr
- Saves scores and distances for each round
- Stores results in a CSV file with links to each game
- Prevents duplicate entries for the same day

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- GeoGuessr account cookie
- (Optional) Google Service Account credentials for Google Sheets integration

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Set required environment variables:
```bash

export GSHEET_CREDENTIALS="path/to/service-account.json"
```

2. Run the script:

The script will create a CSV file named `daily_challenges.csv` in the current directory with your game results.
If Google Sheets integration is enabled, it will also append the data to your spreadsheet.
